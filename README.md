**Huffman Coding for Text Compression**

**Overview**

This project implements the Huffman coding algorithm for text compression. Huffman coding is a widely used technique to efficiently compress data, particularly in the context of lossless data compression.

**Features**

HuffmanCode Class: Manages the Huffman coding process, including constructing the Huffman tree, assigning codes, encoding, and decoding.
minHeap Class: Represents a min heap of binary trees, crucial for efficiently building the Huffman tree.
BinaryTree Class: Represents a binary tree used in the Huffman coding process, with methods for assigning codes, encoding, decoding, and printing.

How to Use
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/huffman-coding.git
cd huffman-coding
Compile and Run:

bash
Copy code
g++ huffman.cpp -o huffman
./huffman
Follow Console Prompts:

Input the number of symbols, characters, and their frequencies as prompted.
The program will demonstrate the Huffman coding process, including encoding and decoding.
Example
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
// Include other necessary headers...

int main() {
    // Example usage of HuffmanCode class
    HuffmanCode huffman;
    return 0;
}
