**Huffman Coding for Text Compression using C++**

**Overview**
This project implements the Huffman coding algorithm for text compression. Huffman coding is a widely used technique to efficiently compress data, particularly in the context of lossless data compression.

Features
**HuffmanCode Class:** Manages the Huffman coding process, including constructing the Huffman tree, assigning codes, encoding, and decoding.
**minHeap Class:** Represents a min heap of binary trees, crucial for efficiently building the Huffman tree.
**BinaryTree Class:** Represents a binary tree used in the Huffman coding process, with methods for assigning codes, encoding, decoding, and printing.
